#  Monitoring ICMP Traffic: Real-World Detection Tools

This guide lists practical tools and techniques to monitor ICMP traffic, detect abnormal spikes, and visualize patterns commonly associated with ICMP-based DDoS attacks.

---

##  Objective
Deploy tools that alert or visualize ICMP anomalies (e.g., sudden ping floods, malformed echo requests).

---

##  Tool 1: Wireshark (Deep Packet Inspection)
- Open-source network protocol analyzer
- Filter for ICMP:
  ```
  icmp
  ```
- Look for:
  - Rapid Echo Requests without Replies
  - High `Time-to-Live` or duplicate IPs (spoofing)

### Useful Display Filters:
- `icmp.type == 8` (Echo Request)
- `icmp.type == 0` (Echo Reply)
- `icmp && frame.len > 200` (Oversized pings)

---

##  Tool 2: ntopng (Web-Based Network Traffic Monitor)
- Real-time traffic analysis
- Tracks bandwidth per protocol/IP
- Highlights unusual ICMP traffic visually

### How to Install (Debian-based):
```bash
sudo apt install ntopng
```
Access via: `http://localhost:3000`

---

##  Tool 3: iftop (Live CLI Bandwidth Monitor)
- Lightweight, terminal-based
- Displays real-time connections
- Press `t` to toggle ports, `s` for source

Install:
```bash
sudo apt install iftop
```

---

##  Tool 4: Zabbix or Prometheus + Grafana
- Full alerting/dashboard stacks
- Track ICMP throughput via ping checks or SNMP
- Build custom alerts (e.g., ICMP packet spike > threshold)

---

##  Why It Matters
You can’t defend what you can’t see. Monitoring helps detect attacks early, before denial-of-service symptoms spread across your environment.

---

##  Lab Ideas
- Simulate ICMP spike with:
  ```bash
  ping -f -s 100 <target>
  ```
- Visualize the spike in Wireshark or ntopng
- Use baseline vs anomaly thresholds in Prometheus or Zabbix

---

##  Learner Notes
- I found Wireshark really intuitive once I filtered for ICMP types, it helped me see how flood patterns look in real time.
- `ntopng` surprised me with how easy the dashboard setup was. I didn’t expect traffic flows to be so clear visually.
- I still want to experiment more with setting up alerts in Prometheus/Grafana, but the basics of monitoring ICMP feel a lot more approachable now.

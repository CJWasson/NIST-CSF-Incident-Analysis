#  How to Use the NIST CSF to Respond to Any Cybersecurity Incident

This guide provides a general, repeatable framework for applying the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to a wide range of incidents — from DDoS attacks and phishing to insider threats and malware infections.

The five core functions of the CSF — **Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover** — work together to help security teams understand and manage cybersecurity risks before, during, and after an incident.

##  1. IDENTIFY
Lay the foundation for effective response by knowing your environment.

### What to Do:
- Inventory all devices, users, applications, and data assets
- Classify which systems are critical to operations
- Document access rights and data flow paths
- Map common vulnerabilities and known gaps (e.g., unpatched systems, shadow IT)

### Incident Use:
- Helps you know what was impacted and why
- Reveals weak points that may have enabled the attack

---

##  2. PROTECT
Put safeguards in place to minimize attack impact or prevent recurrence.

### What to Do:
- Apply least privilege access and multifactor authentication (MFA)
- Patch vulnerabilities and misconfigurations
- Configure firewalls and endpoint protections
- Backup critical systems regularly

### Incident Use:
- Helps contain and limit further spread
- Reinforces vulnerable systems post-incident

---

##  3. DETECT
Establish the ability to discover and confirm abnormal or malicious activity.

### What to Do:
- Monitor logs from endpoints, firewalls, and servers
- Set up alerts for anomalies, spikes, or failed logins
- Use tools like IDS/IPS, SIEM, and behavioral analytics

### Incident Use:
- Enables fast identification of attack patterns
- Supports forensic timeline and impact analysis

---

##  4. RESPOND
Take decisive action to eliminate the threat and mitigate damage.

### What to Do:
- Isolate affected systems (e.g., infected endpoints or flooded servers)
- Execute a documented response playbook
- Notify stakeholders and legal/compliance teams
- Document actions, timelines, and decisions

### Incident Use:
- Shortens the duration and scope of the incident
- Helps coordinate consistent, compliant response efforts

---

##  5. RECOVER
Restore operations and strengthen defenses for the future.

### What to Do:
- Reimage systems or restore from verified backups
- Conduct a post-incident review and root cause analysis
- Improve hardening, training, or detection gaps found during response
- Update playbooks and policies

### Incident Use:
- Helps rebuild trust and ensure the incident does not repeat
- Prepares your organization for stronger resilience going forward

##  Tips:
When responding to any attack (e.g., ransomware, phishing, insider threat, or DDoS), walk through these five functions as a checklist. Ask:
- What should I identify?
- What protections failed or need to be applied?
- What should have been detected earlier?
- What do I need to respond quickly?
- How do we recover and improve?

This makes your response strategic, not reactive.

#  NIST CSF Quick-Reference Table

This condensed guide summarizes the five core functions of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) into a table format for fast recall and implementation.

| Function   | Purpose                            | Key Questions to Ask                                        | Common Actions                            |
|------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Identify**   | Know your assets & risks            | What systems are critical?  
What’s vulnerable?  
What’s normal? | Asset inventory, risk assessment    |
| **Protect**    | Safeguard systems & data            | Are we patched? Who has access?  
Is MFA enforced?        | Access control, encryption, patching |
| **Detect**     | Spot incidents & anomalies          | Do we monitor logs? Are alerts configured?                  | SIEM, IDS/IPS, behavioral alerts          |
| **Respond**    | Contain and minimize damage         | How do we isolate systems?  
Who needs to be notified?  
What’s the plan? | Incident playbook, legal response   |
| **Recover**    | Restore systems and improve         | Are services restored?  
What did we learn?       | Restore from backup, post-mortem    |

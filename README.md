# NIST-CSF Incident Analysis

This project contains a structured incident report based on the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**. The scenario involves an **ICMP-based Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack** that disrupted internal network services within a multimedia organization.

##  Project Overview

- **Framework Used:** NIST Cybersecurity Framework  
- **Incident Type:** ICMP Flood (DDoS)  
- **Organization Type:** Multimedia (Web Design & Marketing)  
- **Duration of Incident:** ~2 hours  
- **Impacted Services:** Internal email, shared drives, and printing systems  

The report outlines how the organization applied the five NIST CSF functions:  
`Identify → Protect → Detect → Respond → Recover`

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used

- NIST CSF for incident response modeling
- ICMP traffic analysis and detection strategies
- Firewall configuration and spoofed IP detection
- IDS/IPS deployment planning
- Recovery and business continuity process

##  Learning Objectives

- Practice identifying, analyzing, and responding to cybersecurity threats using structured frameworks
- Demonstrate knowledge of DDoS mitigation strategies
- Apply security hardening, detection, and incident handling procedures

##  Why I Built This

As a lifelong learner transitioning into cybersecurity, I built this project to practice applying the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to a real-world incident scenario — a simulated ICMP-based DDoS attack.

My goal was not only to understand the theory, but to get hands-on with the tools, commands, and configurations used by professionals. I’ve documented each solution in a way that other learners can follow step-by-step — just like I would have wanted when I was starting out.

This project reflects who I am: someone who learns by doing, takes time to understand the why behind every step, and wants to help others on the same path.

You don’t have to be an expert to get started — but this repo will help you think like one.

# NIST-CSF Incident Analysis

This project contains a structured incident report based on the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**. The scenario involves an **ICMP-based Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack** that disrupted internal network services within a multimedia organization.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- **Framework Used:** NIST Cybersecurity Framework  
- **Incident Type:** ICMP Flood (DDoS)  
- **Organization Type:** Multimedia (Web Design & Marketing)  
- **Duration of Incident:** ~2 hours  
- **Impacted Services:** Internal email, shared drives, and printing systems  

The report outlines how the organization applied the five NIST CSF functions:  
`Identify → Protect → Detect → Respond → Recover`
